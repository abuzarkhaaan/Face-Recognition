# Face Detection Using One-Shot Learning with 49% Face Hidden

## Overview

This project aims to detect faces using one-shot learning, even when 49% of the face is occluded. The primary objective is to create a model that can accurately identify faces in challenging scenarios where parts of the face are hidden, such as masks, scarves, or other obstructions. One-shot learning is used to ensure the model can learn from very few examples and generalize well to new individuals.

## Features
- **Robust Face Detection**: Capable of detecting faces with significant occlusions (up to 49% of the face hidden).
- **One-Shot Learning**: Leverages few-shot techniques to identify new individuals with minimal training data.
- **Occlusion Handling**: Specifically designed to deal with partially hidden faces, such as masks, sunglasses, or head coverings.
- **Real-Time Application**: Suitable for real-time face detection in various environments, including surveillance and access control.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project includes images of people with different levels of facial occlusion, ensuring a diverse set of conditions:
- **Partial Occlusion**: Faces covered with masks, scarves, or hands.
- **Lighting Conditions**: Images in various lighting environments, including indoor and outdoor settings.
- **Ethnicity and Gender Diversity**: Faces from different ethnicities and genders to improve the model's robustness.

### Data Labeling
The dataset will be labeled to mark key facial features and bounding boxes for the visible parts of the face. Labeling should include:
- **Bounding Boxes**: For the visible portion of the face.
- **Key Facial Features**: Eyes, nose, and any other visible parts, with a focus on accurately annotating partially visible features.

## Requirements
To run the face detection system using one-shot learning, you will need:

- Python 3.8+
- **PyTorch** for deep learning support
- **OpenCV** for image processing and video capture
- **FaceNet** or **Siamese Network** for one-shot learning
- **Albumentations** for data augmentation

You can install the required packages using:
```sh
pip install torch opencv-python facenet-pytorch albumentations
```

## Model Architecture

The model uses a Siamese network for one-shot learning:
- **Feature Extraction**: Uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to extract features from the input images.
- **Similarity Measurement**: The Siamese network compares two images to determine if they belong to the same person, making it ideal for scenarios with limited training data.
- **FaceNet Pre-trained Model**: FaceNet is used as a base for extracting facial embeddings, which are then compared using cosine similarity.

## Training the Model

1. **Prepare the Dataset**:
   - Gather images with varying levels of facial occlusion.
   - Label the dataset with bounding boxes for the visible portions of faces.

2. **Train the Siamese Network**:
   - Train the model to differentiate between pairs of imagesâ€”whether they belong to the same individual or not.
   - Use contrastive loss to optimize the model's ability to distinguish between similar and dissimilar faces.

   ```python
   python train_siamese.py --dataset path/to/your/dataset --epochs 50 --batch_size 32
   ```
   - Replace `path/to/your/dataset` with the actual path to your dataset.

## Testing and Evaluation

After training, evaluate the model on a test set of images with occlusions:

```python
python test_siamese.py --model path/to/your/best_model.pth --test_data path/to/test_dataset
```
- Replace `path/to/your/best_model.pth` with the trained model path.

The model should be able to identify faces correctly, even when up to 49% of the face is hidden.

## Real-Time Face Detection
For real-time detection, use a connected webcam to provide video input to the model:

```python
python realtime_face_detection.py --model path/to/your/best_model.pth
```
- The script will use the webcam feed to detect and identify faces in real-time, including those with occlusions.

## Deployment
The trained face detection model can be deployed in different environments:
- **Access Control Systems**: To identify individuals at entry points, even if they are wearing masks.
- **Surveillance Cameras**: Monitor areas while detecting individuals with partially covered faces.
- **Mobile Applications**: Deploy on mobile devices for applications like contactless attendance systems.

## Future Work
- Improve model accuracy by incorporating more training data with different types of occlusions.
- Expand to support full facial recognition by including more individuals in the one-shot learning dataset.
- Integrate with cloud-based services for large-scale deployment, including video feeds from multiple locations.
